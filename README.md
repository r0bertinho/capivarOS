Making short therms, this is just a little project of mine, a lightweight operating system based on this premises:
-   Using the utilities I like best in other OSes;
-   Discarting the ones I hate;
-   Maintaining it to being light(no useless stuff);
-   Being able to open, read and edit almost any time of file.

-   PS: In atition, this is inspired in a friend of mine who loves capibaras.
